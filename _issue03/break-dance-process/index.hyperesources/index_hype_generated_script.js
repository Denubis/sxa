Each pocket is a thought exercise, as I look for forms that will help me better corral and interpret content. It is part of a constellation of projects by myself and other irlH members, and across projects we have been interested in matters of time, space, and digital experience, looking at a diverse range of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx texts situated across the Americas. Structurally, the project extends a series of conceptualizations: notions of asymmetrical articulation as set forth by Zora Neale Hurston in \u201cCharacteristics of Negro Expression,\u201d Antonio Ben\u00edtez-Rojo\u2019s description of the modern Caribbean as being historically constituted as a series of vast interlocking machines, and Kwame Dawe\u2019s 2012 poem \u201cStop Time.\u201d <i>.break .dance</i>  also of course draws a sense of kinship and belonging from the work collectively understood as Black Code Studies, as set forth by Jessica Johnson and Mark Anthony Neal.<br><p></p>\n   \n<p>\u201cCoding\u201d in <i>.break .dance</i> is understood as instrument, practice, and heuristic, for thinking about my own and other\u2019s acts of encoding and decoding. The title <i>.break .dance</i> itself bespeaks the work of ontology in basic web development, wherein <i>.x </i>is used to mark classes of representation. A class structures style and behavior, so that a wide range of attributes can be applied to a web element by tagging it with the class. By understanding .break and .dance as classes, I am able to put into relation a range of disparate artifacts, and being so hands-on with my artifacts helps me suss why they call to me.</p> \n\n<p>As a meditation on what it means to think about digital experience beyond (before?) standardized platform, <i>.break .dance</i> intentionally relies on the most basic web technologies\u2014 html, javascript, and css, while at the same time, through the user\u2019s screen movements, defamiliarize some of those workings. Sometime some things just don\u2019t act right. It is a homebrew project that I can easily show others how to make, but that is not made with exact reproducibility in mind. As a project specifically interested in the temporal dimensionality of internet experience, <i>.break .dance</i> is encoded with cascading timers, a kind of temporal machinery that works with and against the site\u2019s form, a kind of slow movement that forces readers to feel time and, by extension, witness their own bodies in thought. Indeed, <i>.break .dance </i>is a project committed immersive experience as a kind of errant thought, to explorations that are not about being lost and to moments of authorship that are not centered in a sense of writing as the orchestration of hearing and re-citing voices.  </p>   \n",x:"visible",a:299,Z:"break-word",b:50,y:"preserve",j:"absolute",z:1,k:"div",s:"HelveticaNeue-Light,'Helvetica Neue Light',Helvetica-Light,HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",aT:8,d:781,c:608,aS:8,t:14,G:"#000000",aU:8,r:"inline"}}},{A:{a:[{p:4,h:"28"},{p:4,h:"27"}]},o:"15",p:"600px",cA:false,Y:1400,Z:900,c:"#FFFFFF",L:[],bY:1,d:1400,U:{"370":{V:{"369_hover":"531","369_pressed":"532","Main Timeline":"530"},W:"530",n:"rt arrow cross"},"381":{V:{"383_hover":"539","Main Timeline":"538"},W:"538",n:"lf arrow cross"}},T:{"539":{b:[],c:"381",z:1,i:"539",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#D0181F",s:"#000000",o:"536"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#D0181F",z:0,o:"536",f:"c"}],n:"383_hover",s:"381",f:30},"530":{b:[],c:"370",z:0,i:"530",a:[],n:"Main Timeline",s:"370",f:30},kTimelineDefaultIdentifier:{i:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",n:"Main Timeline",z:124,b:[],a:[{f:"c",y:119,z:5,i:"e",e:0.14000000000000001,s:0,o:"535"},{y:124,i:"e",s:0.14000000000000001,z:0,o:"535",f:"c"}],f:30},"531":{b:[],c:"370",z:1,i:"531",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#D0181F",s:"#000000",o:"528"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#D0181F",z:0,o:"528",f:"c"}],n:"369_hover",s:"370",f:30},"538":{b:[],c:"381",z:0,i:"538",a:[],n:"Main Timeline",s:"381",f:30},"532":{b:[],c:"370",z:1,i:"532",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#A9A9A9",s:"#000000",o:"528"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#A9A9A9",z:0,o:"528",f:"c"}],n:"369_pressed",s:"370",f:30}},bZ:180,O:["537","533","534","535","536","381","528","370"],n:"Untitled Layout","_":1,v:{"528":{b:1,z:3,K:"None",c:90,L:"None",d:53,aS:6,M:0,bD:"none",N:0,aT:6,dB:"button",O:0,g:"#FFFFFF",aU:6,P:0,bF:"370",aV:6,j:"absolute",k:"div",aI:4,aJ:4,aK:4,aL:4,A:"#A0A0A0",B:"#A0A0A0",aM:"531",Z:"break-word",C:"#A0A0A0",r:"inline",D:"#A0A0A0",aN:"532",t:13,aA:{a:[{d:1.1000000000000001,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},F:"center",G:"#000000",aP:"pointer",w:"<span style=\"font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u21e2</span><br>",cM:true,x:"visible",I:"None",a:-3,y:"preserve",J:"None"},"534":{c:97,d:74,I:"None",J:"None",K:"None",L:"None",aP:"pointer",M:0,N:0,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{p:0}]},j:"absolute",O:0,k:"div",dB:"button",z:11,C:"#D8DDE4",D:"#D8DDE4",B:"#D8DDE4",P:0,a:212,aD:{a:[{i:120,b:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",p:9,symbolOid:"14"},{p:0}]},b:230},"381":{cS:true,x:"visible",a:201,cA:false,b:786,j:"absolute",bX:false,c:102,k:"div",z:8,cL:"381",d:65,bY:1,cK:{a:[{b:"538",p:3,z:false}]},bZ:180,cM:true,cV:[]},"537":{aV:8,w:"<b>:: processing, plenitude, and clairvoyance / 1</b>",x:"visible",a:217,Z:"break-word",b:23,y:"preserve",j:"absolute",z:12,yy:"nowrap",s:"Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",aT:8,k:"div",aS:8,t:16,r:"inline",aU:8,G:"#000000"},"533":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:581,aV:8,d:722,r:"inline",s:"HelveticaNeue-Light,'Helvetica Neue Light',Helvetica-Light,HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",t:14,Y:18,Z:"break-word",w:"<p>\u201cWe might say that Caribbean texts are \u2018fugitive\u2019 by nature\u2026 If we look at the most representative Caribbean texts we see that the discourse of \u2018content\u2019 is erased by forms that are non-discursive, circular if you like, which finally come forth as the only vehicles able to lead the reader (and the text) to the plenitude of Being and non-Being, of the here and now together with the oblivious and absent.

It invites users to play and adjust, to lay hands and find things in unexpected places, and to sink into reading and watching and thinking. Indeed, in my day job(s) I have had the opportunity to produce dozens of projects using technically stable and (rightfully) professionalized platforms. The form of  <i>.break .dance</i> takes conceptual inspiration from contemporary thinking in speculative computing, and works to embrace the asymptotic yet resolutely indexical deliciousness of the broken and fragmented, the elicitation of continually emergent linguistic experiences. </p><p>Behind this also thrums Frances McDonald and Whitney Trettien\u2019s advocacy for the importance of following fragments in \u201cA Threshold is an Opening\u201d: </p><p>\u201cThe pleasure of creating fragments comes from the dawning realization that, as Eve Sedgwick puts it, \u2018[A] sentence may be actually inexhaustible.\u2019 Because we are taught to swallow books whole, we tend to think of individual clauses as mechanical parts that work together to advance a plot or an argument. As a digital scrap, detached \u2018from its material form, the sentence-turned- fragment becomes dexterous, sticky, promiscuous. It hurtles itself toward other fragments, combining and recombining to create new relations between and across texts.\u201d </p><p>Breaking, not just looking for the breach,  <i>\u00e1 la</i> deconstruction, but rather actively looking for ways to enter spaces in-between of states juridical, psychic, emotional, or otherwise, and out of such space, glimpsing freedom. As is always the case, Zora Neale Hurston is incredibly helpful in thinking about how such freedoms are made. In \u201cCharacteristics of Negro Expression,\u201d Hurston\u2019s description of the iterative and interactive, and intersubjective dimensions of Black dance performance, which she characterizes as a dancer\u2019s embrace of \u201cdynamic suggestion,\u201d which forces spectators to participate in the performance itself. By attending to the gap between oneself and one\u2019s audience, the dancer is able to elicit out of that gap an experiential imagination of all possible worlds:</p><p>\u201cthe Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests. Since no art ever can express all the variations conceivable, the Negro must be considered the greater artist, his dancing is realistic suggestion, and that is about all a great artist can do.\u201d </p><p>In her own mining of what \u00c9douard Glissant would later refer to in  <i>The Poetics of Relation </i>as the \u201cclairvoyance of relational poetics,\u201d Hurston identifies how participation itself arises out of gaps between what the mind knows, anticipation, and what will be created anew at the moment of reception. From the club to the basement to any space where bodies and music meet, every rhythm carries and transmits an epistemology, and the audience\u2019s anticipation of the performer\u2019s next move or sound quivers at the edge of prophecy. When the performer\u2019s move makes onlooker\u2019s bodies move, that movement already feels like something known and understood, even as that knowledge comes into being through the newness of the onlooker\u2019s own physical, emotional, or psychic response.

I have been working with this as a larger conceptual framework for the last decade, most recognizably in my first monograph, <i>Haunting and Displacement in African American Literature and Culture. </i>In that project I developed paradigms for haunting, which is a term I give to experiences of knowledge that come to us from other people, times, and places, but that are experienced with the ontological force of personal memory. I have returned to that work recently because haunting is paradigmatically useful for thinking about the affective life of digital experience, and the inherently strange spatio-temporal positionalities that arise out of such experience. In \u201cSample | Signal | Strobe\u201d I elaborate haunting as a strategy for doing a kind of Black digital humanities work, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis the conceptual implications of social media as a conduit for news about Black people\u2019s deaths.<br></p>\n \n<p class=\"p1\">I mention these projects because <i>.break .dance</i> has become the step between \u201cSample | Signal | Strobe\u201d and the beginning of the <i>Black Haunts in the Anthropocene</i> project. As I discuss in <i>.break .dance</i>, while working on the <i>Black Haunts</i> project I found that I kept returning to the idea of being haunted by internet experience: </p>\n \n<p class=\"p3\"><i>.break .dance</i> began with a map or, more specifically, a chance encounter with a data visualization. And while my experience of that map soon became the kernel of a larger project about space, temporality, and ecological disaster\u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blackhaunts.mp285.com/\"><i>Black Haunts in the Anthropocene</i></a> \u2014 that feeling of random and digital encounter stayed with me.&nbsp;What I initially experienced as a complex intermingling of comprehension, apprehension, and agency in internet navigation resonated with what in <i>Haunting and Displacement</i>&nbsp;I previously characterized as the haunted dimensionality of Black diasporic life. For even as the larger orientation of the&nbsp;<i>Black Haunts</i>&nbsp;project is about water and wind and earth, about varieties of backwater blues and parable tales, the experience that transited me to those considerations was about blackness, space, and time, about glitches\u2014errors that reveal structures, and breaks\u2014uncomfortable emergences of pasts and their affects and their rearticulations.\u201d</p>\n \n<p class=\"p1\">This notion of glitching, and of errors that reveal structure, returned me to some previous thinking about \u00c9douard Glissant\u2019s deployment of the rhizomatic and his articulation of errantry in <i>Poetics of Relation</i>. Across projects I am interested in the Americas as a fundamentally digital lifeworld, which means resetting the historical timeline for the digital away from devices and instead centering populations\u2019 historical experiences, digitality. Glissant\u2019s terms are useful to this line of thinking because each brings us toward methods for managing the psychic and material effects of Black diasporic displacement, an interplay further elaborated in Katherine McKittrick\u2019s attentiveness to holding, simultaneously, the geographic and un-geographic realities of Black spatial experience in the wake of the Atlantic slave trade. The cascades of spatial and temporal feelings elicited by hypertext are also useful to this exploration, and <i>.break .dance</i> stages a variety of asynchronic and asymmetrical approaches to thinking about what it means to think with the screen, rather than merely imagining the screen is yet another way to reproduce paper. <i>.break .dance </i>is about what it means to represent intellectual process, and is thus also a meditation on what surfaces thought before thought becomes argument, and also what it means to honor the intensely layered and dimensionally scattered places from which the threads of insight emerge. </p>\n \n<p class=\"p4\">Further, if we indeed accept that different scholars indeed come from different intellectual, cultural, and social places, then how do we take seriously the challenge of representing how people from different communities come to knowledge differently? When is difference understood as difference, rather than merely as wrong, as a glitch in a system? As Lori Emerson frames it in \u201cGlitch Aesthetics,\u201d a glitch helps us to make a</p>\n<p class=\"p6\">\u201cradical shift in what counts as an aesthetic object or aesthetic experience and asserts that its disruptiveness (in that a glitch constitutes a moment of dysfunctionality in the computer system) defamiliarizes the slick surface of the hardware/software of the computer and so ideally transforms us into critically minded observers of the underlying workings of the computer.\u201d</p>\n \n<p class=\"p1\">Following Irisdelia Garcia\u2019s work in <a href=\"http://digitalvaiven.com/essay/Atlas.html\"><i>the digital vaiv\u00e9n: ghosts, the glitch, and puerto rican embodiment</i></a>, when considered from a minoritized political position, glitches can be \u201cunderstood as \u2018malfunctions\u2019 that are truly defining.\u201d Taken as a call to look for the moments and spaces wherein the systems that produce our social lives falter, a glitch becomes a powerful digital analog for experiences that might otherwise be understood as haunting and uncanniness. A glitch is what is generated when a signal goes wrong, so in a digital process when rows of code, while processing, unintentionally skip a line, or when a mechanical process misses a beat, generating a new \u201cis.\u201d Glitch aesthetics attend to what is made in such moments, as moments of error, like an unintended breakpoint in a code, also offer forth artistic or interpretive opportunity, a moment of creation in the sense that something new is made, refreshed and referential, and interpretive because something about underlying technical structure is glimpsed in that moment of error, thus also opening a space for modalities of inquiry and contemplative experience \u00c9douard Glissant describes as errant thought. In <i>.break .dance</i>, glitchiness is used as an aesthetic strategy that bears on the presentation of content and the limits of such presentation. It is where we ask questions, where we sink below the text, or where we wait to see what might re-emerge differently.</p>\n \n<p class=\"p4\">Even as the <i>.break .dance</i> project is about continually reproducing a rhizomatic site of inquiry, it also helps me consider the deep extent to which hypertextual experience is as much a matter of time as it is of space and place, and that these glitched movements can thus point us toward the vast interlocking machineries that worked to establish enslavement as a foundational social and economic system of the U.S. and Caribbean. \u201cThere was a time,\u201d Ben\u00edtez-Rojo writes, \u201cin which I believed that the code book to reading the Caribbean was the plantation.\u201d In the following short provocations, I name some of the theoretical orientations that became the structural argument for how and why <i>.break .dance</i> works in ways similar to what Ben\u00edtez-Rojo describes as a kind of meta-machine, braiding, braiding, braiding across the times and spaces of inquiry. </p>\n",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:1,aS:8,aT:8,a:201,b:33},"545":{x:"visible",k:"div",c:394,d:275,z:3,e:0,a:822,j:"absolute",b:575},"548":{aV:8,w:"<b>:: errantries not errors</b>",x:"visible",a:201,Z:"break-word",b:16,y:"preserve",j:"absolute",z:7,yy:"nowrap",s:"Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",aT:8,k:"div",aS:8,t:16,r:"inline",aU:8,G:"#000000"}}},{A:{a:[{p:4,h:"27"},{p:4,h:"28"}]},o:"52",p:"600px",cA:false,Y:1400,Z:2000,c:"#FFFFFF",L:[],bY:1,d:1400,U:{"370":{V:{"369_hover":"531","369_pressed":"532","Main Timeline":"530"},W:"530",n:"rt arrow cross"},"381":{V:{"383_hover":"539","Main Timeline":"538"},W:"538",n:"lf arrow cross"}},T:{"539":{b:[],c:"381",z:1,i:"539",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#D0181F",s:"#000000",o:"536"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#D0181F",z:0,o:"536",f:"c"}],n:"383_hover",s:"381",f:30},"530":{b:[],c:"370",z:0,i:"530",a:[],n:"Main Timeline",s:"370",f:30},kTimelineDefaultIdentifier:{i:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",n:"Main Timeline",z:370,b:[],a:[{f:"c",y:180,z:3,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"557"},{y:183,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"557",f:"c"},{f:"c",y:345,z:3,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"554"},{f:"c",y:345,z:3,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"553"},{y:348,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"554",f:"c"},{y:348,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"553",f:"c"},{f:"c",y:360,z:10,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"555"},{y:370,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"555",f:"c"}],f:30},"531":{b:[],c:"370",z:1,i:"531",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#D0181F",s:"#000000",o:"528"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#D0181F",z:0,o:"528",f:"c"}],n:"369_hover",s:"370",f:30},"538":{b:[],c:"381",z:0,i:"538",a:[],n:"Main Timeline",s:"381",f:30},"532":{b:[],c:"370",z:1,i:"532",a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:1,i:"G",e:"#A9A9A9",s:"#000000",o:"528"},{y:1,i:"G",s:"#A9A9A9",z:0,o:"528",f:"c"}],n:"369_pressed",s:"370",f:30}},bZ:180,O:["560","551","557","556","550","554","552","553","555","559","536","381","558","528","370"],n:"Untitled Layout","_":4,v:{"556":{c:124,d:70,I:"None",J:"None",K:"None",L:"None",aP:"auto",M:0,N:0,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{i:180,b:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",p:9,symbolOid:"51"}]},j:"absolute",O:0,k:"div",dB:"button",z:18,C:"#D8DDE4",D:"#D8DDE4",B:"#D8DDE4",P:0,a:672,aD:{a:[{i:180,b:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",p:9,symbolOid:"51"}]},b:340},"551":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:592,aV:8,d:1885,r:"inline",s:"HelveticaNeue-Light,'Helvetica Neue Light',Helvetica-Light,HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",t:14,Y:17,Z:"break-word",w:"\n\u201cI think I ought to clarify at this point that when I speak of a machine I am talking about the machine of machines, the machine machine machine machine; which is to say that every machine is a conjunction of machines coupled together, and each one of these interrupts the flow of the previous one; it will be said rightly that one can picture any machine alternatively in terms of flow and interruption.\u201d<p></p><p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u2014 Antonio Ben\u00edtez-Rojo, \u201cThe Repeating Island\u201d\n</p><p>In the context of Antonio Ben\u00edtez-Rojo\u2019s figuration of the Caribbean as an infinite series of interlocking machines, the tresillo\u2019s slanted symmetries might be said to evoke what Zora Neale Hurston, decades earlier, described as a kind of fundamental unbrokenness to be discerned in the apparent contradiction between rhythm and asymmetrical movement in Black art.<br></p>\n<p>One might think here of how the gears of a clock, moving in different directions, reprinting the passage of time, but doing so through a series of oppositional movements. No one piece is responsible for the whole. Now explode this ticking clock so that each of its gears becomes observable to us in different times and spaces. The clock is still ticking, but without a grasp of its dimensionality, each piece is only perceivable in its own localized appearance, incompletely rendered. Carried by Sub-Saharan Africans to the Americas, the tresillo is a rhythm that articulates dimensional machineries. Edging more notes into every beat, the access to the tresillo helps performers find a little bit more space in the beat: a pocket that makes space for the three in the span of the two, the power of the hybrid temporalities instantiated in the aftermath of the Atlantic slave trade.</p>\n<p> Hurston, maybe more than anyone before or since, understood how to plumb the theoretical possibilities embedded in the daily materialities of Black diasporic expressivities, and never hesitated in thinking about how Black lives cross time, space, and medium. Dead serious with tongue in cheek, Hurston\u2019s \u201cCharacteristics of Negro Expression,\u201d for instance, demonstrates what it means to hold and experience all the divergent parts of blackness within a single frame, and the kinds of spiritual, aesthetic, or conceptual magic such acts of holding make possible. In looking for productive and unbroken languages that can help me think about fragmentation, I have turned to Hurstons\u2019 description of asymmetry in Black art:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe presence of rhythm and lack of symmetry are paradoxical, but there they are. Both are present to a marked degree. There is always rhythm, but it is the rhythm of segments. Each unit has a rhythm of its own, but when the whole is assembled it is lacking in symmetry. But easily workable to a Negro who is accustomed to the break in going from one part to another, so that he adjusts himself to the new tempo.\u201d</p>\n<p>In describing the Caribbean as a series of machines, Ben\u00edtez-Rojo can be used to broaden Hurston\u2019s notion of asymmetry to account for how cultural forms can be encoded by social and economic systems, but also subsequently generate their own decryption keys:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Caribbean machine, on the other hand, is flow and interruption at once; it is an absolute machine, a meta-machine, which cannot be diagrammed and whose user\u2019s manual may be found scattered among its own network of codes\u2026 In any event, the notion of polyrhythm (rhythms cut through by other rhythms which are cut by still other rhythms)\u2014 if it takes us to the point at which the central rhythm is displaced by other rhythms in such a way as to make it fix a center no longer, then to transcend into a state of flux\u2014 may fairly define the type of performance that characterizes the Caribbean cultural machine.\u201d</p>\n<p> But in remixing Deleuze and Guattari, Ben\u00edtez-Rojo is able to identify how pockets of resistance are seeded and accessed by the enslaved and their descendants. Here, Ben\u00edtez-Rojo\u2019s invocation of codes and coding works on several registers, which offers some insight into polyrhythm as inseparable from the social, political, and economic machineries that have historically attempted to reduce the people of the Caribbean into machines (which is to say that the presence of Africa descended people in the Caribbean is of course the absolute sign of the machineries\u2019 high and efficient functioning). We use the word code as a catch-all for the instructions we use in order to program machines to behave, language in its barest sense, rules and structures. Encoding is the act of making data readable in the terms set forth by that code structure. We use the term \u201ccodeswitch\u201d to talk about what it means to move between different or competing structures, encoding our language and comportment to become readable by a given machine. We also use \u201ccode\u201d to denote practices wherein the substitution or compression of terms can be used to hide information. In Ben\u00edtez-Rojo\u2019s example, an individual\u2019s infinite capacity to codeswitch, to move across rhythms, also reduces the power of encoding itself. The transcendence of which Ben\u00edtez-Rojo speaks, flux, thus emerges as a state of constant change. In computing terms, it is unclear whether this flux is the antithesis or apotheosis of code. Indeed insofar as .break and .dance are organizing classes of Black experience, breakdancing is actually something else, machinic movement that is also something more, the body that astonishes by moving into a heretofore unimaginable state. The flux and the glitch.</p>\n<p>In \u201cSample | Signal | Strobe,\u201d for instance, I look at how coding and compression make it possible for people under surveillance to communicate in the open, knowing that the people around them do not know how to read the right signs, cannot sense the code nor its deployment. The polyrhythmic is also ruled by code, and also instantiates the presence of encoding: if you know to know, a tresillo tells your body to do something differently, that you have found your people, that you are in a kind of space, that you are in a pocket.</p>\n<p>Both Hurston and Ben\u00edtez-Rojo describe asymmetry/polyrhythm as a kind of formal complexity, not randomness but instead the body broken down, the parts of a clock, keyed to a rhythm that can only be decrypted through the onlooker\u2019s participation, through their willingness to find the beat and to be moved by it. Even when you cannot see it, you can feel it if given the opportunity to move into it. In the break, breaking it down, the space between the body\u2019s movement are extended, making available an expansiveness of human experience compressed into a series of discrete significations given whole expression through the audience\u2019s immersion and interactivity with the performance.</p>\n<p>Polyrhythm is glitching named as a function of time, the layering of asynchronic parts to elicit a new wholeness. Asymmetry names the glitch as a function of flow\u2014 Hurston describes asymmetric movement as the embodiment of interruption in the service of larger, meta, continuity. Brought together, we come to what Kwame Dawes describes as \u201cstop time,\u201d which is the rhizomatic cultural precipitate of \u201cAfrican-based syncopations in music.\u201d Stop time, as Kwame Dawes describes it, is that which \u201ctend to seduce us and enliven us with the illusion and reality of how rhythm can be manipulated.\u201d The act of manipulation, again, for instance, the three in the two, opens whole worlds of possibility. In <i>.break .dance</i>, I use a figure of a tendwa map to denote the kinds of passages across time and space made available by cultural engagements that let us tap into this power and possibility: the tresillo, the pop and lock, the ringshout. The tendwa is not a map to a lost home; this is not a story about nostalgic return. But \u201cstop time\u201d is mandate, invocation, and description.</p>\n<p>Dawes continues:<br></p>\n<p>\u201cStop Time, like the seeming off-kilter of reggae\u2019s rhythm, for instance, or the irresistible \u2018pockets\u2019 in dancehall rhythms and the clave patterns of the rumba, is often the basis of the swoop and sway of the dances that it creates. I have been fascinated by the way in which stop time is a beautiful and persistent piece of luggage Africans have carried with us even without knowing it is there, and in the poem the church becomes the place where it finds sacred power\u2014a metaphysical moment of helplessness that relies on faith\u2014the gap, the absence, the separation\u2014before the bridge of faith that spans the gap and brings us safely home.\u201d</p>\n<p>In mining gaps, the intersubjective space between intuition and groove, it becomes more clear how the things we carry with us can also be honed into powerful acts of decryption, into strategies for joy and resistance, the dance in the break.</p>",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:4,aS:8,aT:8,a:197,b:42},"528":{b:1,z:3,K:"None",c:90,L:"None",d:53,aS:6,M:0,bD:"none",N:0,aT:6,dB:"button",O:0,g:"#FFFFFF",aU:6,P:0,bF:"370",aV:6,j:"absolute",k:"div",aI:4,aJ:4,aK:4,aL:4,A:"#A0A0A0",B:"#A0A0A0",aM:"531",Z:"break-word",C:"#A0A0A0",r:"inline",D:"#A0A0A0",aN:"532",t:13,aA:{a:[{d:1.1000000000000001,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},F:"center",G:"#000000",aP:"pointer",w:"<span style=\"font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u21e2</span><br>",cM:true,x:"visible",I:"None",a:-3,y:"preserve",J:"None"},"559":{c:387,d:44,I:"None",J:"None",K:"None",L:"None",aP:"auto",M:0,N:0,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{i:360,b:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",p:9,symbolOid:"51"}]},j:"absolute",O:0,k:"div",dB:"button",z:20,C:"#D8DDE4",D:"#D8DDE4",B:"#D8DDE4",P:0,a:197,aD:{a:[{i:360,b:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",p:9,symbolOid:"51"}]},b:1646},"554":{h:"254",p:"no-repeat",x:"visible",a:0,q:"100% 100%",b:0,j:"absolute",dB:"img",z:1,k:"div",bF:"552",d:289,c:289,r:"inline",e:0},"381":{c:102,d:65,cA:false,aP:"pointer",cS:true,cK:{a:[{b:"538",p:3,z:false}]},bF:"558",j:"absolute",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{d:1.5,p:1,g:2,f:2}]},k:"div",cL:"381",dB:"button",z:2,cM:true,bX:false,cV:[],bY:1,a:0,bZ:180,b:0},"370":{c:102,d:65,cA:false,aP:"pointer",cS:true,cK:{a:[{b:"530",p:3,z:false}]},bF:"558",j:"absolute",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{d:1.5,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},k:"div",cL:"370",dB:"button",z:1,cM:true,bX:false,cV:[],bY:1,a:541,bZ:180,b:0},"560":{aV:8,w:"<b>:: mined the gap</b>",x:"visible",a:197,Z:"break-word",b:9,y:"preserve",j:"absolute",z:17,yy:"nowrap",s:"HelveticaNeue-Light,'Helvetica Neue Light',Helvetica-Light,HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",aT:8,k:"div",aS:8,t:14,r:"inline",aU:8,G:"#000000"},"557":{I:"None",x:"visible",a:850,J:"None",K:"None",j:"absolute",b:227,z:6,L:"None",k:"div",d:247,U:"iframe-tresillo.html",c:301,e:0,V:"0",W:""},"552":{k:"div",x:"visible",c:289,d:313,z:9,a:856,j:"absolute",b:737},"555":{G:"#005493",aU:8,c:340,aV:8,d:59,r:"inline",e:0,s:"Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",t:12,Z:"break-word",w:"<font><span class=\"s4\" style=\"font-family: Optima, &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; text-align: left; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">\u201c</span><span class=\"s5\" style=\"font-family: Optima, &quot;Lucida Grande&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration: none; text-align: left; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">Your ancestors\u2019 homes died in the water, as the familiar dirt and mountains and trees became memory.

Perhaps due to their nascent and fragmented states, the two inquiries soon began to intertwine. The first came out of some writing for the 2016 CENHS conference at Rice, as I played around with the lyrics of Bob Marley\u2019s 1979 \u201cRedemption Song.\u201d I was thinking about hybrid time in a project I have been framing as <i>Black Haunts in the Anthropocene</i>, and kept hearing Marley\u2019s \u201cnone of them can stop the time,\u201d which for me elicited a sense of power emanating from outside enslavement and its vicissitudes, and resonated with a kind of ecological millenarism common to Black popular music in the Americas. In the course of that research I came across Kwame Dawes 2012 poem, \u201cStop Time,\u201d which brought me back to previous thinking to Fred Moten\u2019s <i>In the Break</i>.<br></p>\n \n<p class=\"p1\">This rhizomatic action is equally evident in Dawes and Marley, as both writers cast nets to either side, their work echoing pieces of other things\u2014 Marley for instance riffing on Marcus Garvey\u2019s \u201cThe Work That Has Been Done,\u201d and Dawes drawing from Hebrews 11:1, perhaps via James Baldwin, \u201cthe evidence of things not seen.\u201d In both cases, something nagged at me about each, but meaning was elusive. This is something more than simply recalling references; rather it is more like a kind of haunted citation that stops itself short of recitation. I, in turn, found myself haunted by these haunted texts. What does thinking about such movement make possible, and how does one think about it? In <i>Haunting and Displacement</i>, I explored phenomenologies of haunting across multiple valences. With projects like <i>.break .dance</i>, I am interested in methods of inquiry informed by a kind of critical hauntology.</p>\n \n<p>I returned to critical hauntology in trying to understand what I experienced as a series of uncanny movements in Melina Matsoukas\u2019 video for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 single, \u201cFormation,\u201d a kind of strangeness that stayed with me. I first turned to constructing a visual inquiry, isolating the moments that stayed with me. There is of course much to say about \u201cFormation,\u201d and about the <i>Lemonade</i> visual album as well, but my purpose in invoking <i>Lemonade </i>in <i>.break .dance</i> is as an illustration of a mode of thinking. This is not at all to suggest that <i>Lemonade</i> does not deserve critical attention, but instead to highlight a sense of the things that work on us as scholars, which is a bit different than only thinking about texts as texts that we work over. </p>\n \n<p>This is what I saw in \u201cFormation\u201d that led me to this larger engagement with matters of machinery and code in Black diasporic life:</p>\n \n<p>The \u201cFormation\u201d video includes a series of images of Beyonc\u00e9: black dress, bolero hat, silver jeweler. The bolero standing on the porch of what looks to be a plantation manor and her manner of dress, as I describe it in <i>.break .dance</i>, bespeaks power. She is dressed like someone who <i>owns</i>. Her dance generates a sense of the uncanny, of discomfort. This is a house, but it is not a home. Mining this vein, <i>.break .dance</i> continues:</p>\n \n<p>\u201cWhen the bolero figure first appears in \u201cFormation,\u201d the men are still like statues as she jerks her head up and down in what can only be described as hyper-responsiveness of a marionette, the effect heightened because the figure\u2019s eyes are never exposed, magic or trance. The stillness of her body matches that of her retinue, but the head flies up and down, paced a sliver ahead of the song\u2019s beat, marking yet somehow also missing the song\u2019s time. Throughout the song this ever so slightly off beat movement continues with these scenes, and it is particularly notable because so much of the video's choreography is danced expressively on the song\u2019s notes, which is to say that the timing is clearly and intentionally impeccable. Much as the scenes of Beyonc\u00e9 wearing denim and dancing on the street are made to ghost like old VHS recordings, the jerking head\u2019s movement ghosts the beat. Indeed, much as the video version of the song reboots itself every time it samples Messy Mya or Big Freedia\u2019s voice, Matsoukas introduces multiple instances of glitched representation, interrupting the smooth continuity of pop performance with an intimation of technological failure shifts, out which emerge increasingly resonant possibilities.\u201d</p>\n \n<p>The bolero figure\u2019s dance, like a pop and lock that never transmits its signal to its next component, to another bodily movement, is discomfiting in its incompletion. Quite different from what I elsewhere discuss as Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s description of asymmetrical beats and movements that generate a thirdspace of relation, an embodied machinery that produces spatial and temporal transcendence through contradistinction. The bolero figure\u2019s movement ghosts the tresillo inflected asymmetry of Black performance in the Americas, but stops short. This stop marks the place of the uncanny, which in this context resonates with Buse and Stott\u2019s articulation, following Freud, of uncanniness as a name for how \u201cThe familiar and secure is always haunted by the strange and unfamiliar, while the unfamiliar often has a troubling familiarity about it\u201d and that \u201cThe experience of the Uncanny might be summed up as that moment when the seemingly natural reveals itself to be cultural after all.\u201d</p>\n \n<p>If we are following the thematic of \u201cslavery in the machine,\u201d then the bolero figure\u2019s glitched movement, its incomplete pop, this stop that is not a lock, reveals a gap. Live action is revealed as animation.

Much as Ntozake Shange would create the term \u201cchoreopoem\u201d to describe her 1975 for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf, artists constantly create new representational forms that better express the social, cultural, and historical paradigms out which their work arises. Across .break .dance I take, as objects of contemplation, excerpts from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album <i>Lemonade</i>. Even as it tells a story, moving across the stages of a woman\u2019s reckoning with infidelity, in its orchestration of multiple voices, layered sites of authorship, and parlaying poetry and dance to make implicit and explicit claims grounded in the most private sites of racial and sexual injustice, <i>Lemonade</i> shares many similarities with the formal innovation of Shange\u2019s choreopoem. As collages, both texts show their seams, and in so doing produce intersubjective spaces of encounter between reader, idea, and text. Trettien and McDonald identify the power of forms that rely on gaps and fragmentation to invite readers to generate meaning in the spaces between and around things. \u201cSome strange alchemy occurs in the moment a sentence becomes a fragment\u2014\" they write, \"it simultaneously gains both heft and dexterity.

This magic perhaps nowhere more evident than during the appearance of a Mardi Gras Indian Queen in <i>Lemonade</i>\u2019s final quarter movement. Her appearance crosses multiple boundaries simultaneously, as the flash of her white bodysuit is the flash of an orisha, her headdress flashes as a Native American headdress, and the flick of her tambourine smudges the space, also perhaps referencing drumming in Santeria, <i>tambour</i>, or perhaps the rattle invokes the <i>atchere</i>, announcing the polyrhythmic soundscape of a <i>toque</i>, a song for an orisha.</p><p>\nIn her sprawling and masterful 1991 novel <i>Almanac of the Dead</i>, Leslie Marmo Silko\u2019 uses the experiences of Clinton, an itinerant African-American Vietnam War veteran, to highlight a sense of shared spiritual dimensionality across Black and Indigenous communities in the Americas. In <i>Almanac</i> he turns to oral histories and also his college courses in Black Studies to build conceptualize and popularize a paradigm for Black survivance (drawing again on Vizenor\u2019s term), rather than merely relying on the habits of survival that have come to mark his own life. In Clinton\u2019s cosmology, in which he explicitly describes the Americas as a space in which \u201cgreat American and great African tribal cultures had come together to create a powerful consciousness within all people\u201d\u2014  one can understand Legba, Gede de Rouge, Ogun, the Maize Mother, Damballa, loas, Quetzacoatl, as nodes in a web, access granted through various media of ritual and practice:</p><p>\n\n\u201cClinton wanted black people to know all their history; he wanted them to know all that had gone on before in Africa; how great and powerful gods had traveled from Africa with the people. He wanted black Americans to know how deeply African blood had watered the soil of the Americas for five hundred years. But there had been an older and deeper connection between Africa and the Americas, in the realm of the spirits. Yet for a while, it must have seemed to the Africans who had survived ocean crossings that their gods had indeed forsaken them.\u201d </p><p>\n\nOne foundation for Clinton\u2019s sense of connectedness is his own memory of his family\u2019s own tales of intermarriage with Cherokee tribal members, and also his memories of Mardi Gras Indian Queens. In <i>Almanac</i>, the Indian Queens are syncretized signifiers for material yet ephemeral (spatially and temporally sited) resistance\u2014 <i>marronage.</i> </p> \n",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:58,aS:8,aT:8,a:3158,b:159},"598":{b:1,z:3,K:"None",c:90,L:"None",d:53,aS:6,M:0,bD:"none",N:0,aT:6,dB:"button",O:0,g:"#FFFFFF",aU:6,P:0,bF:"480",aV:6,j:"absolute",k:"div",aI:4,aJ:4,aK:4,aL:4,A:"#A0A0A0",B:"#A0A0A0",aM:"609",Z:"break-word",C:"#A0A0A0",r:"inline",D:"#A0A0A0",aN:"610",t:13,aA:{a:[{d:1.1000000000000001,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},F:"center",G:"#000000",aP:"auto",w:"<span style=\"font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">\u21e2</span><br>",x:"visible",I:"None",a:-3,y:"preserve",J:"None"},"480":{c:102,d:65,cA:false,aP:"pointer",cS:true,cK:{a:[{b:"611",p:3,z:false}]},bF:"596",j:"absolute",x:"visible",aA:{a:[{d:1.5,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},k:"div",cL:"480",dB:"button",z:1,cM:true,bX:false,cV:[],bY:1,a:457,bZ:180,b:0},"585":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:694,d:156,aV:8,r:"inline",e:1,s:"HelveticaNeue-Light,'Helvetica Neue Light',Helvetica-Light,HelveticaNeue,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",t:16,Y:18,Z:"break-word",w:"<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Dimensionality can be exhausting, which is to say that today we are also giving thanks (by the second drink) for membership in good support communities.

I chose the term \u201cpocket\u201d to describe my sense of a kind of digital writing that foregrounds experiences of inquiry. A pocket is what happens between a hunch and the later connection of that feeling to a larger set of research questions.

We come upon Beyonc\u00e9, dressed in a wax cloth dress, sifting through an antique trunk tied with memory ribbons. Here she is more guide than protagonist, as her movements in and out of spaces hyperlink those spaces over time, for instance from the picture-strewn path, into the candle-lit rooms that visually resonate as part of a colonial fort in the Caribbean, or perhaps a slave castle like Cape Coast, Goree, or Elmina. At the beginning of this movement, we first encounter her as a reflection in a mirror. The space, though dark, is also cut by swaths of daylight.</p>\n\n<p>This resonance is amplified as the scene segues immediately into images of cast members holding pictures of loved ones killed by racial violence. Though there is no commentary offered, the cast members\u2019 appearances are interspersed with those of Black women whose children, namely Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner, had been recently killed in acts of police violence. Each child\u2019s photo is held by a mother, respectively Sybrina Fulton, Lesley McSpadden, and Gwen Carr, women who would later remain recognizable throughout #BlackLivesMatter as \u201cMothers of the Movement.\u201d Their inclusion in the space of the text radically shifts <i>Lemonade</i>\u2019s emphasis from matters of infidelity, power, trust, and recuperation to larger questions of identity, civic membership, and mourning, now further refracted as facets of Black women\u2019s lives. Filmed just a few months after the women\u2019s losses, having them appear together in the same span of film, and with each woman staged similarly in her grief, strengthens the sense of each woman\u2019s loss as part of a larger phenomenon. Each loss is scattered temporally and geographically, yet each is also historically and socially linked, an example of Black diasporic digitality (which I discuss at length in \u201cSample | Signal | Strobe\u201d). </p>\n<p>This sense of moving across time and space is also heightened by the alternating uses of color and black and white photography, and also because the different women in the interlude are filmed using different aspect ratios which, generates a sense of device difference that emphasizes spatial and temporal difference, even as the overlaying of James Blake\u2019s song \u201cForward\u201d and the timing of the camera\u2019s zoom into each woman\u2019s photo over the entire segment heightens continuity. Indeed, this comes to a head in McSpadden\u2019s moment, as her tears and the subtle shaking of her head, a soft \u201cno,\u201d remind us of her fresh pain and also names the gift of her allowing an eminently private loss to continually resonate as a public one, a kind of civic intimacy.</p>\n\n",x:"visible",a:176,y:"preserve"},"628":{c:1199,d:1979,I:"None",cY:"0",e:1,J:"None",r:"inline",K:"None",L:"None",M:0,i:"particles-js",w:"",N:0,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",j:"absolute",B:"#D8DDE4",k:"div",O:0,C:"#D8DDE4",z:12,P:0,D:"#D8DDE4",a:1,b:0},"617":{h:"348",p:"no-repeat",x:"visible",a:153,q:"100% 100%",b:61,j:"absolute",dB:"img",z:2,k:"div",bF:"616",d:265,c:176,r:"inline",e:1},"623":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:421,aV:8,d:25,r:"inline",e:0,s:"Optima,'Lucida Grande',Helvetica,sans-serif",t:16,Z:"break-word",w:"-- Leslie Marmon Silko, <i>The Almanac of the Dead: A Novel</i>",bF:"622",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:4,aS:8,aT:8,a:408,b:174},"626":{h:"474",p:"no-repeat",x:"visible",a:594,q:"100% 100%",b:0,j:"absolute",dB:"img",z:5,k:"div",bF:"622",d:222,c:244,r:"inline",e:0.050484572784810132},"621":{bJ:1,c:601,BDbI:1,bK:1,d:338,e:0,bL:0,aO:"0",BDbG:0,BDbL:0,bE:"268",aH:"1",BDbJ:1,aQ:"1",j:"absolute",x:"visible",aR:"1",BDbH:0,bG:0,k:"video",z:10,bH:0,bI:1,a:299,BDbK:1,b:10},"629":{bJ:1,G:"#FF2F92",aU:8,BDbI:1,bK:1,aV:8,r:"inline",e:0,s:"Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",bL:10.284810126582281,BDbG:0,t:96,BDbL:0,Z:"break-word",BDbJ:1,w:"\u21e3",j:"absolute",yy:"nowrap",x:"visible",bG:0,y:"preserve",BDbH:0,k:"div",z:1,bH:0,aS:8,bI:1,a:574,aT:8,BDbK:1,b:1180},"618":{h:"346",p:"no-repeat",x:"visible",a:0,q:"100% 100%",b:0,j:"absolute",dB:"img",z:1,k:"div",bF:"616",d:718,c:1276,r:"inline",e:1},"624":{G:"#000000",aU:8,c:704,aV:8,d:69,r:"inline",s:"'Avenir Next',Avenir,Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",t:24,Z:"break-word",v:"normal",w:"The signatures of the spirits are outlined in ashes and cornmeal on the ground.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right; \"><font size=\"3\"></font></p>",bF:"622",j:"absolute",x:"visible",k:"div",y:"preserve",z:2,aS:8,aT:8,a:77,b:18}}},{A:{a:[{p:4,h:"327"},{p:4,h:"28"}]},o:"290",p:"600px",cA:false,Y:1200,Z:2000,c:"#000000",L:[],bY:1,d:1200,U:{},T:{kTimelineDefaultIdentifier:{i:"kTimelineDefaultIdentifier",n:"Main Timeline",z:17.24,b:[],a:[{f:"c",y:0,z:3.02,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"631"},{y:0,p:1,i:"Video Track",z:17.24,o:"632",f:"a"},{f:"c",y:0,z:3.02,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"634"},{y:3.02,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"631",f:"c"},{y:3.02,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"634",f:"c"},{f:"c",y:15,z:1,i:"bL",e:0,s:10.284810126582281,o:"633"},{f:"c",y:15,z:1,i:"e",e:1,s:0,o:"633"},{y:16,i:"bL",s:0,z:0,o:"633",f:"c"},{y:16,i:"e",s:1,z:0,o:"633",f:"c"}],f:30}},bZ:180,O:["632","630","631","633","634"],n:"Untitled Layout","_":9,v:{"632":{dA:"0",aR:"1",x:"visible",bE:"281",a:250,b:-16,j:"absolute",c:700,k:"video",z:12,d:394,aO:"0",aQ:"0",aH:"1"},"633":{bJ:1,G:"#FF2F92",aU:8,BDbI:1,c:63,bK:1,d:97,aV:8,e:0,s:"Helvetica,Arial,Sans-Serif",bL:10.284810126582281,BDbG:0,t:96,BDbL:0,r:"inline",Z:"break-word",BDbJ:1,w:"\u21e3",j:"absolute",x:"visible",bG:0,y:"preserve",BDbH:0,k:"div",z:13,bH:0,aS:8,bI:1,a:560,aT:8,BDbK:1,b:1179},"630":{c:1212,d:1989,I:"None",cY:"0",e:1,J:"None",r:"inline",K:"None",L:"None",M:0,i:"particles-js2",N:0,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",j:"absolute",B:"#D8DDE4",k:"div",O:0,C:"#D8DDE4",z:8,P:0,D:"#D8DDE4",a:0,b:0},"634":{c:1224,d:100,I:"Solid",e:0,J:"Solid",K:"Solid",g:"#00FDFF",L:"Solid",M:1,N:1,A:"#D8DDE4",x:"visible",j:"absolute",B:"#D8DDE4",k:"div",O:1,C:"#D8DDE4",z:9,P:1,D:"#D8DDE4",a:-7,cW:{a:[{d:1.5,p:1,g:2,f:1}]},b:1995},"631":{aU:8,G:"#000000",c:827,d:289,aV:8,r:"inline",e:0,s:"Optima,'Lucida Grande',Helvetica,sans-serif",bL:0,t:16,Y:20,g:"#FFFFFD",Z:"break-word",w:"<p>\u201cSandcastles,\u201d the song immediately preceding this section of <i>Lemonade</i>, is a song about lost dreams and marital realities.

Every child might evince a sense of hope, but Black children in the Americas must also instill a sense of fear and foreboding, which is here amplified by the segment\u2019s inclusion of the mothers of the movement. Because the song\u2019s arrival is soon interrupted, it is experienced as intimation of something else. In this way freedom is literally something glimpsed from the future, which further heightens the intense outpouring of emotion that can be released when the song reappears a few minutes later in <i>Lemonade</i>. If in the larger <i>.break .dance</i> project I am interested in working with Hurston\u2019s notion of asymmetrical performance and Dawes\u2019 sense of \u201cStop Time,\u201d it also worth noting here a different kind of temporal effect that must be survived, and that precipitates the cultural responses identified by Dawes and Hurston\u2014 split time.

This movement splices into a shot of the Black women whom we encounter throughout Lemonade, themselves stepping into an outbuilding kitchen, the camera\u2019s eye vertically matching their angle of approach to Beyonce\u2019s. The women are quiet and working. Perhaps it is the appearance of the segment title, \u201cHope,\u201d or the visual abundance of foods with which they work. But their work feels focused and joyful, a sense of presence and competence that stands, and perhaps has always stood, in opposition to historical circumstance: the plantation kitchen is an absolute representation of Black women\u2019s subjugation. At the same time, it also a place that, for fleeting moments, offers a sense of domain, a space of control despite the forces that mandate their presence and action in the space. Their food and its origins, cabbages from Europe, apples from Asia, corn, yuca, cassava, and squash from the Americas, and watermelon from Africa, reflects the broadening of knowledges that have also come to characterize that domain.
