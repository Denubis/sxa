title: Review Guidelines for Digital Projects
---

*sx archipelagos* accepts mid-stage digital scholarship projects beyond
the article or monograph format for single-blind review. Our review
process is crafted in accordance with the [*DHCommons
model*](http://dhcommons.org/journal/submission-guidelines) with some
additions and revisions. Once peer review is completed, projects are
“launched” via a dedicated page on the *sx archipelagos* platform. This
landing page features a brief description of and link to the project,
along with excerpts of audio, visual, and other multimedia elements.
This page also provides a link to (a curated version) of the dialogue
between site authors and peer reviewers. Click *here* for example.

**Project review occurs in two phases:**

-   Phase I - Authors submit a Project Statement consisting of a 350-500 word abstract and a 5000-7000 word description. Reviewers will offer initial feedback within four to six weeks.
-   Phase II - Authors respond to reviewer feedback in a 1000-1200 narrative and provide link to navigable beta site.

Our review guidelines are separated into four different categories: Contribution, Credit, Design, and Preservation.

### Contribution

We ask reviewers to carefully weigh the de facto or possible
intellectual contribution of the project. We ask reviewers to consider the nature of that contribution appropriate to the current stage of development of the project and recommend considering early signs of process-derived knowledge, the project's relationship to existing literature/projects, and/or early conversations in the literature about the project (where appropriate).

- Will the project frame new conversations in the relevant subject area?
- Are the methods used in the project appropriate to the research questions it poses?
- Do the project's methods contribute to digital scholarship in general and, if so, how?

### Credit

This section asks reviewers to be conscious of the labor that went into the making of a digital project. As many have argued, digital projects depend on more distributed collaboration than monographs or articles. *sx archipelagos* encourages the crediting of work where credit is due, and the acknowledgment of the scholarly and interpretative work involved in data curation, design, and the engineering of digital projects. With this in mind, we ask reviewers to ask the following questions of a reviewed project:

- Does the project credit its contributors openly and fairly?
- Are the labor conditions under which the project was produced made evident?
- Does the work cite its (digital scholarship) precedents and data sources appropriately?

### Design

Although design constitutes a separate category of review, we ask reviewers to understand design in terms of its relationship to the purported intellectual contribution of a given project. For *sx archipelagos*, design includes back-end architecture, workflow, and front-end interface design. We ask reviewers to consider the overall temporal and technical structure of a project, and how this structure relates to the goals of the project. A reviewer may ask questions like:

-   How do effort and resources used in the project match its import?
-   How does the graphic and UX design elements of the front-end contribute to the goals of the intellectual contribution? When considering the public-facing design, we ask reviewers not to place undue weight on 'ease of use,' or 'glossy design' but rather to consider whether the project's features fit the intellectual mission of the project and the resources the project's team had available to them.
-   How does the backend architecture hinder or move forward the contribution of the project, and perhaps relate it to previous digital scholarship projects?

### Preservation

When considering the life-cycle of a digital scholarship project we ask
reviewers not to consider preservation in terms of indefinite periods of
time. We encourage authors to be realistic about the plausible rate of
decay of their projects, and to have plans in place to manage the
obsolescence of the technologies it uses. We welcome projects with a
minimum of two years post-beta support. We encourage our reviewers,
therefore, to look for signs that the project team has considered the
project’s future. Possible questions are:

-   What standards have been used and why?
-   How robust is the documentation on the project? Could the project be decomposed and recomposed based on this documentation?
-   How is the project managing its rate of decay?
-   Is the level of complexity of the project appropriate for its socio-technical or institutional context?
-   How conscious is the project team regarding the life-cycle of the project?
