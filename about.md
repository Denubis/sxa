*sx archipelagos* is a born-digital complement to and extension of the small axe print journal. Peer-reviewed and adherent to the quality standards—substantive and aesthetic—established by *small axe*, *sx archipelagos* shares a mission and a vision with the journal. We aim to provide a space for debate and sustained critical thinking, and do so with an eye fixed on a particular kind of present and future. As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we ask what spaces or paths Caribbean Studies must occupy and travel with respect thereto. *sx archipelagos* features three distinct valences of peer-reviewed critical production: text-only or multi-media enriched, prose-based scholarly articles; digital scholarship projects; and digital project reviews.

 

## How we did it

Our open-access journal is designed based on minimal computing principles. We sought to strike a balance between costs, complexity, our reader's experience and technological learning curves, while retaining control of our text and code. For that reason we priviliged the use of plain-text and open-source technologies that a small team of editors could reasonably deploy with some basic training.

Thanks to a generous grant from the NEH Office of the Digital Humanities, we had the flexibility to prototype a minimal computing production flow that we could share with future editors looking to minimize their costs and technolical debt, and perhaps gain control of all aspects of their journal production. All of our code and data resides open source on [the archipelagos account on Github](). Our website consists of static HTML pages generated using Jekyll. Our PDFs are created using the same markdown files used to create the web pages. Since the process is automated, this reduces the need for individualized layouts for each issue, in turn reducing the cost of producing the journal. The review process for the first issue was conducted solely through email. Our initial costs involved the creation of the stylesheets that give our site and PDF's their unique look.
