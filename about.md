*sx archipelagos* is the latest born-digital articulation of the Small Axe Project. It is a peer-reviewed publication platform adhering to the intellectual and aesthetic standards established by the Small Axe Project, and it complements and extends the work of the *Small Axe* print journal and *sx salon*. The mission of *sx archipelagos* is to provide a space for debate and sustained critical thinking, and do so with an eye fixed on a particular kind of present and future. The transformation of the academy by the digital revolution presents challenges to customary ways of learning, teaching, conducting research, interpreting documents, and presenting findings. It also offers immense opportunities in each of these areas. New media enable oration, graphics, objects, and even embodied performance to supplement existing forms of scholarly production as well as to constitute entirely original platforms. Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration have expanded enormously, information has been made more accessible, and research made more efficient on multiple levels. We scholars are called upon now, with some urgency, to adapt our investigative and pedagogical methods to an academic climate deluged by a superabundance of information and analysis. This has created opportunities for open-ended and multiform engagements, interactive and continually updating archives and other databases, cartographic applications that enrich places with historical information, and online dialogues with our colleagues and the wider public.

The need for such engagements is especially immediate among the people of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Information technology has become an increasingly significant part of the way that people in the region frame pressing social problems and political aspirations. Aesthetic media like photography and painting - because they are relatively inexpensive and do not rely necessarily on formal training - have become popular among economically dispossessed and politically marginalized constituencies. Moreover, the Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean itself as a dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others and elsewheres in relentless relation. Yet while we celebrate these opportunities for connectedness, we also must make certain that our work in the digital realm undermines and confronts rather than re-inscribes forms of silencing and exclusion in the Caribbean.

As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we ask what spaces or paths Caribbean Studies must occupy and travel with respect thereto. How might we, as publishers and ourselves Caribbeanist scholars, encourage and facilitate our colleagues’ investment in the production and dissemination of the knowledge they generate? How will we go about cultivating both producers and reviewers of quality digital scholarship, and how will we help to ensure that this scholarship is recognized and rewarded by the profession? How might we encourage collaboration with, increase accessibility for, and otherwise work to narrow the gap between Caribbeanist researchers, especially those in the North Atlantic academy, and the communities we are committed to serving? If it is true, as we believe, along with Bajan-British Jazz saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings and philosopher-poet-activist-musician Sun Ra that only "communities that have agency [are] able to form their own philosophical structures,” we mean to work toward achieving that kind of autonomy. *sx archipelagos* is committed to empowering Caribbean and Caribbeanist scholars, artists, and other social and creative actors in their efforts to deploy the tools of our time.
