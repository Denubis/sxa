*sx archipelagos* is a born-digital complement to and extension of the small axe print journal. Peer-reviewed and adherent to the quality standards—substantive and aesthetic—established by *small axe*, *sx archipelagos* shares a mission and a vision with the journal. We aim to provide a space for debate and sustained critical thinking, and do so with an eye fixed on a particular kind of present and future. As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we ask what spaces or paths Caribbean Studies must occupy and travel with respect thereto. *sx archipelagos* features three distinct valences of peer-reviewed critical production: text-only or multi-media enriched, prose-based scholarly articles; digital scholarship projects; and digital project reviews.
