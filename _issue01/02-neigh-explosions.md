## Introduction

If Louise Bennett, the prolific Jamaican artist, were still alive and performing today, how would the Internet fit into her creative practice? Would she post poetry recordings on Facebook? Would children play with a Miss Lou app? Would Aunty Roachy deliver wisdom via Twitter? Since she embraced emerging technologies to teach her audience about the value of the Jamaican language, social media likely would have played a prominent role in her education activism. She turned to performance early in her career to build an inclusive audience, and her media projects for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation--her children’s television show *Ring Ding* (1970–82) and her radio program *Miss Lou’s Views* (1966–82)--gave her an expanded terrain to develop her call-and-response poetics.

Unfortunately, searching for Louise Bennett online today yields few actual sound recordings of her poetry. While the recently created Louise Bennett website improves her web presence, it currently includes only text versions of her poems.[^1] Bennett’s underrepresentation online--or, more aptly, her silence, since her words can be found but rarely her voice--is characteristic of Caribbean poetry more generally. This article stems from concern about who has the power to define poetry in virtual spaces and whose voices receive airtime. As Kamau Brathwaite establishes in his groundbreaking essay *History of the Voice*, Anglophone Caribbean poetry should be celebrated for its “sound explosions,” yet it has remained relatively quiet online.[^2]

Internet audio archives for poetry have flourished in recent years. Websites such as PennSound, the Electronic Poetry Center, The Poetry Archive, the Poetry Foundation, the Academy of American Poets, and UbuWeb have provided excellent resources for building an audience for contemporary poetics. These twenty-first-century open-access collections offer both live and studio recordings, roundtable discussions of poetry, lectures, and taped interviews. While these digital platforms promise democratization, they often repeat the exclusions of print archives. Many of these collections, which now determine the content of poetry syllabi in university classrooms, reinforce the United States as the dominant center of Anglophone poetry in the Americas.[^3] For example, the Poetry Foundation has 3,649 author pages, almost half of which are devoted to US poets. The site features only eleven poets from the Caribbean region.[^4] As this miniscule number suggests, many major Caribbean poets are missing, including Louise Bennett. Although the site has many recordings, none of the Caribbean author pages includes audio poems. Of the eleven Caribbean poet pages, only seven of them include actual poetry texts; the other four just feature short author bios. Not only are Caribbean poets underrepresented in these curated collections but their online presence is often sparse, limited to random YouTube videos.[^5]

Yet the digital realm holds great potential for Caribbean poets who privilege performance to promote oral ways of knowing. Digital recording tools and Internet audio archives offer a solution to what Laurence A. Breiner has characterized as the “half-life” of Caribbean performance poems.[^6] According to him, readers unable to attend a poem’s live performance are always at a disadvantage. Studying the poem on the page leaves one unable to experience how things like tone, gesture, and the poet’s relationship with her audience determine meaning. While recordings cannot replace direct participation in the live event, they document more than the printed page. In terms of distribution, digitized poetry recordings, unhindered by shipping fees and trade tariffs, surpass print books in their international portability, making them more accessible to Caribbean diasporic communities. Oral poetry scholar John Miles Foley also establishes how electronic media’s hypertextuality makes it “uniquely suited to represent” oral forms.[^7] But what’s at stake here is not just form but also politics. For nation language poetry in particular--Brathwaite’s term for Anglophone Caribbean poetry that draws on Afro-centric oral traditions and privileges the spoken word--digital recording technologies can be used to realize the integration of creative and political praxes.[^8] For nation language poets, performance challenges the way that paper records were used to discredit oral ways of knowing and uphold institutional power during colonization. When a dub poet like Linton Kwesi Johnson recites definitive works such as “Reggae Sounds,” lines such as “foot-drop find drum, blood story / bass history is a moving / is a hurting black story” deliver an attack on print-centric forms of knowledge.[^9] He builds on a history of Caribbean people using performance to circumvent the print archive to produce, record, and transmit knowledge through embodied acts.[^10]

Politics and pedagogy are inseparable in nation language poetry. Many nation language poets aim to teach their audiences not in a didactic authoritarian way but by creating through performance their own communal pedagogies. The format of Bennett’s *Ring Ding*, where she would invite children from the live studio audience to join her on stage to sing and recite poetry with her, exemplifies this well. Such communal pedagogies also extend to adult audiences. For example, Oku Onuora defines the goal of dub poetry as consciousness-raising: “It also mean to dub out the isms and schisms and to dub consciousness into the people-dem head.”[^11] The live performance event, by creating what Brathwaite characterizes as “total expression,” engenders a space for this collective politicized vernacular consciousness to take shape. He explains:

The other thing about nation language is that it is part of what may be called *total expression*…. Reading is an isolated, individualistic expression. The oral tradition on the other hand demands not only the griot but the audience to complete the community: the noise and sounds that the maker makes are responded to by the audience and are returned to him. Hence we have the creation of a continuum where meaning truly resides.[^12]

Meaning comes from the permeability of sound, and the audience co-creates meaning with the performer. According to Brathwaite, the full experience of the sonic continuum depends on live interaction; however, this article examines strategies for translating it into a virtual realm. My main example will be the youth-led artist collective The 2 Cents Movement, based out of Trinidad and Tobago, who use social networking sites to circulate their video poems. They present themselves as a movement to align their performance poetry with social change. Their populist approach, which combines education and activism, builds on the vernacular pedagogical dynamics of performance established by figures like Louise Bennett. They use digital forms to supplement the live performance event and to make total expression available to virtual audiences.

Although digital technologies hold many possibilities for Caribbean performance poetry, I focus on how to translate the sonic experience of total expression online, because I believe that this is the most pressing question. Critical approaches to performance poetry have been slow to develop because of the Western assumption that “the text of a poem--that is, the written document--is primary and that the recitation or performance of a poem by the poet is secondary and fundamentally inconsequential to the ‘poem itself.’”[^13] While the digital should free us from our obsession with a text-based idiom in literary studies, it has yet to do so.[^14] As this article will demonstrate, even the designs of most Internet audio archives still privilege the methodology of textual close reading rather than encourage us to develop new sound-based methods of analysis. In a similar vein, recent efforts to build Caribbean digital archives have focused on converting print documents and have not engaged as much with sound media.[^15] Resources and funding certainly drive this, since print materials are easier and cheaper to digitize. Yet given the oral dimensions of Caribbean identities and cultures, we must address how to represent and archive performance to overcome the biases of print archives.

Although print-centrism holds back the critical investigation of performance poetry, so does the fixation on the live performance event, which can make mediated performance forms seem inadequate. For example, Hugh Hodges stresses the difficulty of studying performance poetry. He laments that we typically examine only “the textualized trace of it.”[^16] He considers sound and video recordings as texts, because he argues that the total expression of the live event does not get captured on them. Similarly, Peggy Phelan claims that what she calls “liveness” disappears in recordings of a performance: “Performance’s only life is in the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of representations of representations: once it does so, it becomes something other than performance.”[^17] However, Philip Auslander challenges this limited view. Reassessing “the situation of the live performance in a culture dominated by mass media,” he views digital forms as allowing for varied levels of receptivity between the performer and her audience.[^18] When poets and scholars over-privilege the live event, they merely invert a hierarchy of authenticity (live versus print) rather than consider the more crucial question of how digital forms can be used to translate and even reinvigorate oral performance dynamics.

So much scholarship focuses on written documents and techniques from the past, yet many digital humanists are early adopters. They embrace the unfinished, they invite collaboration, they move us off the page, and they aim to build things for the future. Inspired by this approach, my article examines how The 2 Cents Movement realizes total expression using digital forms and asks how we can design Internet audio archives to build on this. I invite readers to click on the links as they read this article, to immerse themselves in what’s already online, and to think about how we can build on this virtual world of Caribbean poetics.[^19]

## Creating Digital Griots: The 2 Cents Movement

Scrolling through The 2 Cents Movement’s Facebook page reveals a vibrant online poetry community.[^20] At this point, they have more than 11,000 followers on Facebook. Their page includes announcements about upcoming performances, photographs of performances, political news updates, links to live-stream their events, and video poems. Students at the University of the Southern Caribbean started the movement in 2010, and their activities have strengthened youth enthusiasm for spoken-word poetry in Trinidad and Tobago. Its campus origins partly explain why Facebook, a social networking site first designed for college students, has played a central role in the development of the movement. The founder, Jean Claude Cournand, an undergraduate at the time, sought to build a stronger intellectual youth culture--to invite youth to put in their two cents by expressing their views on current issues through spoken-word poetry. In an interview, he explained that they choose “to go into the digital habitat rather than trying to reach people through events alone,” in order to attract a youth audience.[^21] Their performances engage in public debate on issues ranging from marijuana legislation to homophobia. Some of their activities include island-wide school tours, open-mic nights, slam contests, television and radio broadcasts, video production of poems, and student workshops where they teach students how to compose and produce videos of their own poem performances. In their approach, digital recordings become modes of production, publication, distribution, preservation, and community activism.

The 2 Cents Movement has also collaborated with the Trinidad and Tobago Radio Network on the Free Speech Project, where young artists recite their poems weekly on the radio. These poems are also produced as videos and archived on the network’s channel on YouTube.[^22] Their best-known projects are the Intercol and Verses national slam competitions, held annually as part of the Bocas Lit Festival. The two different slams--Intercol features high school teams, and Verses features prominent poets who compete individually--reflect their mentorship structure. The 2015 winner of the Intercol slam, Michael Logie, got to pick a 2 Cents Movement poet as a mentor to work with him for a year to help him develop his poetry.[^23] The majority of the movement’s activities are coordinated and advertised online, and major events like the slam contests can be live-streamed. They exist solely through freely accessible sites and do not have their own server or domain name, which suggests that a lack of resources does not need to be an obstacle to building an online presence for Caribbean performance poetry. In addition to reaching youth in Trinidad and Tobago, they have gained an international following by circulating their poetry on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

Examining Caribbean Internet users’ chatting, blogging, and video-sharing practices, Kevin Adonis Browne illustrates how users adapt everyday vernacular practices to assert their presence in digital public spaces that often render them invisible. While his argument relates to individuals’ everyday encounters online rather than large-scale digital projects, the parallels he establishes between “a carnivalesque imperative” and the Internet lend insight into The 2 Cents Movement’s adaptation of social media to extend the power of total expression to online environments.[^24] Rather than view Caribbean folk cultures in opposition to digital forms, Browne views the inventiveness of both as part of what makes them compatible. He demonstrates how communal vernacular practices easily translate to an online environment because they emerge out of “a history of adaptability” necessary for “those who have had to find a way or make one when none seemed available.”[^25] For example, in the colonial era, musicians’ invented steel pan drumming to get around the ban on using actual drums and managed to make noise in a colonial environment that aimed to silence them. The Internet often reinforces the majority voice, yet it also creates space for the growth of subcultures and social movements. While scholars often critique Facebook and other social networking sites for weakening face-to-face sociality, The 2 Cents Movement reveals how they can be used to deepen social connections and augment the live performance.[^26] By using social media sites, The 2 Cents Movement also makes their performances part of everyday life. People scroll through sites like Facebook as they ride the bus to work, or as they wait in line at the grocery store. This restores an important aspect of Caribbean oral traditions, where yard performances blend into everyday practices rather than become isolated special events.

Often The 2 Cents Movement live-tweets their performances, providing online users the opportunity to experience their immediacy. For example, one could follow their 2014–2015 Courts Bocas Speak Out Tour of more than fifty secondary schools through their Twitter and Facebook updates. During this tour, some of the nation’s best performance poets, including former slam champions, mentored high school students as they wrote and performed their own works through performances and workshops. These school visits provided a way for The 2 Cents Movement to promote the Intercol slam competition. Photo live-tweets of their tour performances often focused on the students actively participating in the audience rather than on the poet performing. In these shots, the camera points at the audience, often catching only the performer’s back or the corner of her shoulder.[^27] The online viewer gets to stare out at the auditorium filled with students, which allows her to occupy the performer’s gaze but also view a student’s face as a mirror, inviting her to identify with both the performer and the audience. This replicates the pedagogy of the live event, where the poets’ performances provide students with a model for their own poetry aspirations. Visually, Twitter followers become situated in the continuum of total expression--in the reciprocal exchange between performer and audience. High school students who attended a 2 Cents Movement performance at their own school could then follow them on Twitter and connect these images to their own participation in the live event. The photos (and the movement as a whole) downplay individual author celebrity in favor of building a student-focused collectivity. The 2 Cents Movement uses Twitter’s capacity to create “a constancy of presence” to link together different high school communities in Trinidad and Tobago.[^28] Yet on Twitter they can only represent total expression visually.

The 2 Cents Movement supplements their visual documentation with their video recordings, which offer members of their online community an opportunity to participate in the sonic elements of their poetics. By storing their poems on YouTube--what Rick Prelinger describes as “the default online moving-image archive”--their poems are available to virtually anyone who has access to the Internet.[^29] They challenge the idea that poetry depends on print publication, since many of their well-known poems are available only in this format. One of their most popular video poems is Crystal Skeete’s “Maxi Man Tracking School Gyal” (originally titled “Yankee’s Gone”). Released in 2013, her video went viral on social media and received more than 85,000 views on YouTube.[^30] Skeete represents the essence of 2 Cents Movement in that she initially attended one of their workshops as a medical student and she is now a leading poet in the movement. She won the 2013 Verses poetry slam with her performance of this poem; however, the popular version on The 2 Cents Movement’s YouTube channel is a studio recording made by BeatOven Productions with videography by Denithy. While the translation of the total expression is more direct on their live event recordings, I want to examine how this studio recording also engenders the communal dynamic of total expression in a different way. Rather than aim to recreate the experience of the live performance event, the video format invites a viewer to feel included in the street scene being depicted. Through their adaptation of the dramatic monologue form and the music video genre, Skeete and the 2 Cents Movement team create a sense of audience connection and encourage dialogue beyond the space of the poem. Their digitally produced poems offer examples of how the language of the music video can inform how we record, edit, and archive poetry.

In “Maxi Man Tracking School Gyal,” Skeete addresses her concern about adult males sexually preying on underage schoolgirls. She writes the poem in the voice of a high school girl, dressing in a government school uniform to play the character in the video. Her embodiment of the character creates a dialogic relationship between her persona and her words because her recitation critiques the behavior that she acts out. The dramatic monologue’s implied addressee is a high school girl who is swayed by a maxi man’s advances, warning her that “these free rides are going to end in horror / trust me / with that nine-month sentence things does go sour.”[^31] Skeete builds on the work of Caribbean performance poets like Miss Lou and Jean “Binta” Breeze who use the dramatic monologue form to give voice to women who are denied respect in the public sphere and to represent women sharing their knowledge with each other. Skeete’s conversational style, enhanced by the video editing and camera angles, encourage the viewer to feel as though Skeete is speaking directly to her. Before the poem begins, Skeete explains, “This is my two cents for change on schoolgirl stereotypes.” After the 2 Cents Movement introduction, the video begins with a shot of a maxi man’s van and Skeete riding in the backseat. The scene starts silently, creating anticipation for Skeete’s recitation to begin. A soca style instrumental track accompanies her words and emphasizes her rhythmic delivery. Filmed on the street, Skeete begins with the lines, “Posing on every street corner / this is the resurrection of ‘Jean and Dinah’… No Yankees here / only maxi man conductor.” Referencing Mighty Sparrow’s calypso hit “Jean and Dinah,” about how the presence of a World War II US army base led to prostitution in Trinidad, she draws attention to how high school girls getting free bus rides from maxi men for sexual favors recreates a similar dynamic. In addition to citing Mighty Sparrow, she also notes that “even a dead Dr. Williams knows that this situation grave” to emphasize the sexual harassment of teenage girls as a national problem. Through an intergenerational call and response, she situates her poem in the Trinidadian oral tradition. She begins her poem as a response to Sparrow’s song and then calls on young girls to take action and solve the problem, encouraging them to use their “inner sense” and telling them “you don’t have to conform.” Skeete’s poem exemplifies how The 2 Cents Movement aims to cultivate a socially conscious form of learning that values vernacular language and knowledge.

Similar to music videos, Skeete’s recitation alternates between a voiceover and her character speaking onscreen. By playing with the boundaries between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, the editing capitalizes on sound’s permeability, encouraging the audience to feel a closer connection to her words. Skeete’s voice extends beyond the boundaries of the video and infiltrates the listening space, collapsing the distance between the onscreen performance and the audience’s mediated experience of it.

In the narrative that unfolds, the videography accentuates Skeete’s embodied performance. While conventional music videos often sexually objectify women’s bodies, the jump cuts between medium shots, medium long shots, and close-ups (often from a slight low angle) emphasize Skeete’s power as she dramatizes her character’s self-actualization and encourages other girls to do the same. Skeete’s words combined with the camera work challenge the male gaze to create a virtual space of female community. This reaches its peak when the speaker sits in the back of the van reciting her critique and a reverse shot depicts the maxi man gazing at her in the rearview mirror. His gaze literally gets reflected back at him, while the speaker verbally refuses his objectification. In the middle of the van, a girl flirts with another maxi man. Throughout the poem, the speaker seems to completely condemn this behavior; however, the poem ends with a surprise twist. As she gets out of the maxi man’s van, she tells the audience, “This brown-skinned gyal / going home and mind she child,” indicating that her advice is based on her own mistakes with a maxi man. In addition to challenging schoolgirl stereotypes, Skeete also challenges the stereotype that “epidemically teenage child mothers” are high school dropouts, since the speaker still goes to school. This surprise ending builds the speaker’s authority (not by separating her from her community but by underscoring her participation in it) and encourages schoolgirls watching the poem to trust her advice.

In the live performance of “Maxi Man Tracking School Gyal,” Skeete’s critique of sexual harassment is likely powerful; however, the video format allows a viewer to experience with greater clarity the embodied experience of resisting sexual harassment on a Port of Spain street. For female viewers who went through something similar, the recreation of the scene and its provocative ending deepens their identification with the speaker. Like a griot, Skeete speaks for a community of young girls, or rather speaks with them, as her performance encourages them to bring their experiences into their interpretation of the poem.

## Redesigning Internet Audio Archives for Caribbean Poetry

While The 2 Cents Movement is not an archival project, their vernacular digital approach offers insight into how we can redesign Internet audio archives to emphasize the call-and-response structure of the live performance event. The underrepresentation of Caribbean poetry in Internet audio archives is symptomatic of the global digital divide, which is especially acute for Africa-descended populations.[^32] However, in his study *The Politics of Caribbean Cyberculture*, Curwen Best points out that “the flip side to the notion of the digital divide is therefore the formation of strategic space. It is this strategic space that opens up an area and arena of knowledge about evolving technologies.”[^33] Here we have an opportunity to evaluate the standards and practices that existing Internet audio archives have established and to think about what will work best for Caribbean poetry.

I agree with Kate Eichhorn, who argues that most poetry sound archives (both digital and analog) have yet to realize the potential of archiving sound due to “the widely held assumption that the archive is necessarily a space of writing and, hence, opposed to speech and other performative acts.”[^34] Eichhorn proposes that we need “to create a sound archive designed to recover and preserve the embodied, interactive, and present nature of the performed word.”[^35] In her assessment, archived poetry recordings too often become “flat and lifeless artifacts.”[^36] Although Eichhorn focuses on avant-garde poets, her arguments apply to Caribbean poets who foreground sound as an integral part of the poem’s meaning. Such work accessible in an archive designed to disrupt our text-based conceptions of archival knowledge would undoubtedly lead us more assertively into other forms of knowing rather than allow the digital to reconsolidate print paradigms.

One notable exception to the underrepresentation of Anglophone Caribbean poets in Internet audio collections is The Poetry Archive, supported by the Arts Council of England. Out of 476 poets, twenty-three are from the Caribbean region.[^37] While this is not a huge percentage, it is considerably more than most sites, and every Caribbean poet page has sound recordings that can be streamed for free or downloaded for a fee of £0.89. The Poetry Archive, like many Internet audio archives, specializes in classroom resources. They have a special page for teaching Caribbean poetry with a selection of sound recordings, individual lesson plans, and “A Guide to the Language of Caribbean Poetry.” This site features more Caribbean poets than most, because the Caribbean Poetry Project--a group of scholars and poets from the Cambridge University Faculty of Education, the Centre for Commonwealth Education, and the University of the West Indies--collaborated with The Poetry Archive to improve access.

The Caribbean Poetry Project’s work with The Poetry Archive has made excellent strides in increasing the web presence of Caribbean poetry and demonstrates how cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional collaborations help to break down Anglo-centrism. Yet analyzing the design of the Poetry Archive author pages reveals that we need to do more than add voices to existing archives. As Amy Earhart cautions, for digital recovery projects for writers of color to be successful, we also must “theorize the technological with the same rigor as we theorize the content.”[^38] If one compares the recording of Linton Kwesi Johnson reciting “Di Great Insohreckshan” on The Poetry Archive with a recording of him performing it at an outdoor festival in Venezuela in 2008 available on YouTube, the total expression feels much more resonant in the YouTube version than on the Poetry Archive site.[^39] In fact, I argue that the design of the Poetry Archive page mutes the insurrectionary tone of Johnson’s poem about the Brixton Riots. Obviously, the YouTube video allows one to see Johnson’s body and facial expressions, which one cannot get from the Poetry Archive audio recording, but it is not as simple as video versus audio or a live event recording versus a studio one. The YouTube version provides more information about the context for the performance, listing the year and the location. The comment function in the YouTube interface also allows listeners to respond to the performance. Although the sound quality lacks the clarity of the Poetry Archive recording, the uneven audio levels provide a more authentic experience of what hearing this poem in a large crowd at an outdoor festival would have felt like. The spontaneity of live performances, including sound glitches and background noises, becomes part of what Brathwaite characterizes as the “sonority contrasts” of total expression.[^40] As Eichhorn points out, “these intruders are precisely what sound technicians often seek to filter out as they prepare recordings for the archive.”[^41] The Poetry Archive version of “Di Great Insohreckshan” follows the predominant sound-editing style for Internet audio archives. Martin Spinelli describes this style as “the seamless edit,” designed to highlight the poet’s voice and minimize all other distractions, including the recording scene (whether live or in-studio) and the “material elements of their production.”[^42]

In addition to using standard sound-editing, Johnson’s author page follows the standard visual design that can be found on The Poetry Archive as well as other online poetry collections. His page features an author portrait (rather than a performance action shot), a biography, and links to individual poem tracks. Beneath the poem title and author name, one can click the play button and listen to the recording. The Poetry Archive uses a simple audio player that allows a listener to start, pause, and stop the track. Johnson’s author biography explains that his poems on the site were recorded from live performances and come from his CD *LKJ A Cappella Live*. Despite the claim that “the energy of his live recitals gives the recordings a unique electricity, interspersed with the laughter and applause of audiences around Europe,” the seamless editing of “Di Great Insohreckshan” allows one to listen to Johnson’s entire recitation before realizing that it is a live performance.[^43] Once the poem ends, the only audible audience noises are a cough and polite applause that slowly fades out. Rather than convey “a unique electricity,” the cough suggests a subdued audience who tried to remain silent until the end of the performance. The page provides no information about the specifics of the event or who the European audience was, although it sounds like it might be a poetry reading in an academic setting. The track certainly holds no trace of a communal “dub consciousness.”[^44] By not clearly identifying the track as a single performance, the archive presents it as the authoritative audio version. In the left-hand margin, under the heading “About the Poem,” it lists the themes as “social, unrest, race, and Caribbean” but provides no information about the Brixton Riots. As compared to the YouTube recording, which is identified as a record of a past performance, the decontextualized version on the Poetry Archive site seems tied only to the user in the present moment.

Derek Furr notes that while online poetry collections devote attention to different aesthetics, what unites them is the idea that hearing a poet voice her own work is crucial to understanding the poem. Yet despite the interest in vocalization, collections tend to downplay the setting of the poet’s reading by providing little information about when and where the performance occurred and why this particular reading was recorded.[^45] While certain sites, such as PennSound, make sure that all of the bibliographic info is embedded in the single file with accurate metadata to ensure that the information remains with the recording, often all that this provides is the date and physical location of the reading.[^46] By divorcing the poem from its contextual setting, this approach erases the reciprocal relationship between the poet and her audience. Furr proposes that poetry recordings (both live and in-studio) become valuable because “when we close listen, we hear not only the sounds of the poem and the poet’s voicing of them, but also the echoes of previous scenes of reading and listening.”[^47] Through webpage design and sound editing, The Poetry Archive downplays the previous audiences of “Di Great Insohreckshan” so that the online user feels as though she is the only person in the audience. Furr borrows Charles Bernstein’s term *close listening* to characterize how a user should engage with audio recordings. Bernstein, co-founder of PennSound along with Al Filreis, proposes close listening as an alternative to close reading, where one prioritizes the materiality of sound and the aural experience.[^48] Yet, in practice, how much does close listening actually deviate from close reading on Internet audio archives?

Anne Murray and Jared Wiercinski, curators of SpokenWeb, a digital collection of live recordings of a Montreal reading series from 1966 to 1977, point out that while most Internet audio archives make listening the focus, their structure makes them multimodal. Accordingly, they stress that the visual elements of online poetry archives need careful consideration. They ask “what kinds of site navigation, audio visualization, design elements and functionalities could be offered by a Web-based spoken word interface, and how these might enhance the listening process and, ultimately, the scholarly endeavor.” [^49] Because very little scholarship exists on how people engage with sounded poems, they acknowledge that their suggestions for “a sound archive ‘recipe’ that other cultural heritage institutions can follow” are based on established reading practices.[^50] They make some helpful suggestions, including using a waveform display for sound visualization, and providing listeners with a media player that allows them more control over the playback. They also suggest incorporating any available images and videos of the performance event, much like The 2 Cents Movement’s photo documentation on Twitter and Facebook. However, other suggestions such as tethering audio playback with a written transcript keep the primary focus on reading rather than listening.[^51] For example, on the Poetry Archive site, beneath the link to play “Di Great Insohreckshan,” one can also click on a “Read this Poem” link. This encourages scholars to engage in what is, for many, the more familiar interpretive practice rather than to develop new modes of analysis based on sound. In digital archives, Bernstein suggests that “poems, set adrift from their visual grounding in alphabetic texts, might begin to resemble the songs from which, for so long, they have been divided.”[^52] However, to achieve this we need to 1) be wary of a one-size-fits-all approach, and 2) carefully design visual elements to encourage sonic engagement rather than to reify a visual economy of text. Such a divide between song and poem has never existed for Anglophone Caribbean performance poets, yet colonial legacies continue to dictate that we read rather than listen to this work.

Even when one is only listening, Internet audio archives often recreate the feeling of solitary reading. Clicking on the link and listening to the poem while one looks at the author portrait (similar to the style found on book jackets) mimics the experience of solitary reading, where one feels in private conversation with the author. Simple audio players that have only a linear time-lapse bar (rather than a more complex waveform display) encourage the eyes to move from right to left, as they do in the act of reading. When a poem is divorced from its previous performance context and presented as a single track, a listener is encouraged to adopt a new critical approach and treat the poem as a self-contained object. Listening, like reading, becomes “an isolated, individualistic expression” rather than a communal endeavor.[^53]

In contrast, The 2 Cents Movement recreates the communal experience of listening to a poem, which according to Brathwaite is a key part of total expression. Their photo tweets and poetry videos make online members feel as though they are a part of their participatory audience.

We have much work to do to figure out how to build Internet audio archives that recreate this communal experience of listening. Everything including the sound editing, interface, database design, and navigation system needs careful consideration to realize the digital potential of total expression. To embark on this work, we need to turn to the poets themselves (and build on their education legacies). In addition to The 2 Cents Movement, the vernacular experiments of pre-digital nation language poets, such as Louise Bennett, offer insight into how digital technologies can be adapted to expand on Caribbean oral traditions.

So much of the history of the voice has already been lost, or muted, by the ongoing colonial bias toward nation language, as well as limited resources and funding. The recordings of Caribbean poetry performances that survive buried in dusty boxes in attics and library storage rooms sit silently waiting for new audiences to return to them “the noise and sounds that the maker makes.”[^54] Since these reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes, eight-tracks, CDs, and LPs are fragile media, threatened by technological obsolescence and even the tropical Caribbean climate (if they are stored there), we must make digitizing this vital record of Caribbean poetry history a priority. In turn, The 2 Cents Movement demonstrates that the “sound explosions” of Caribbean poetry are reaching new and broader audiences online.

    urges that “we need to examine the canon that we, as digital
    humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward traditional
    texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the
    GLBTQ community.”

    On the Poetry Archive site, see
    http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/linton-kwesi-johnson. There are a
    few recordings of “Di Great Insohreckshan” on YouTube. I would argue
    that all of them provide more access to the total expression than
    the Poetry Archive recording, especially if studied comparatively;
    however, I analyze this 2008 Venezuela performance because the
    recording captures the audience’s presence.

    May 2007, http://www.ubu.com/papers/object/06\_spinelli.pdf.
    Spinelli criticizes how poetry sound editing is too influenced by
    traditional radio theory. He questions why most archived poetry
    recordings present sound as though it were a linear medium by using
    “the seamless, invisible, inaudible edit which dislodges nothing,
    which interrupts nothing, which is in fact deployed to remove
    interruption, to remove digression and to clarify” (36).
