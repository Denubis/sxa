# Welcome to *sx archipelagos*


*sx archipelagos* is a peer-reviewed publication platform, the latest born-digital articulation of the Small
Axe Project and its intellectual and aesthetic standards. The mission of *sx archipelagos* is to provide a space for debate and sustained critical thinking, and do so with an eye fixed on a particular kind of present and future. As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we
ask what spaces or paths Caribbean Studies must occupy and travel with
respect thereto. *sx archipelagos* responds with three distinct valences of
critical production: scholarly essays; digital scholarship projects; and digital project
reviews. We offer you our editorial work as a sign of our commitment to Caribbean and
Caribbeanist scholars, artists, and other social and creative actors who toil to reshape our time.
