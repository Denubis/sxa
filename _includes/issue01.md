# Welcome to *sx archipelagos*


*sx archipelagos* is a peer-reviewed publication platform, the latest born-digital articulation of the Small
Axe Project and its intellectual and aesthetic standards. We aim to provide a space for debate and sustained critical
thinking, and to do so with an eye fixed on a particular kind of present
and future. As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we
ask what spaces or paths Caribbean Studies must occupy and travel with
respect thereto. *sx archipelagos* responds with three distinct valences of
critical production: scholarly essays; digital scholarship projects; and digital project
reviews. *sx archipelagos* is committed to empowering Caribbean and
Caribbeanist scholars, artists, and other social and creative actors in
their efforts to deploy the tools of our time.
