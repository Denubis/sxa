caption="Video 3. This credit sequence and early segment from *Freedom
Cry* illustrates the game’s use of language. Subtitles here caption the
language in the cutscenes, with English translations of French,
Trinidadian Creole, and Haitian Kreyole provided in parentheses. Note
that in the gameplay (for example, when the protagonist chases down and
kills the overseer), language is not translated or transliterated."
