## *sx archipelagos* presents *Ramble Bahamas*

A Project by “From Dat Time”: The Oral and Public History Institute of the University of The Bahamas.

## *sx archipelagos* review

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this project. First, I want to congratulate the creators on making such promising headway with such an ambitious agenda: to combine the best of oral history, Caribbean cultural heritage, and walking. It is there, in the last instance, where the project seems to want to make its major contribution: to ramble through the history of the Bahamas. It is also there where perhaps this review can help the most. A word that can mean both a walk taken for pleasure or confusing speech is fitting to describe the dilemmas and room for improvement of the project at the time of review. 

I trust that the intention of the creators is to provide a relatively random encounter with "Bahamian participation in World War II, national politics in the postwar era, the evolution of the nursing profession, and the development of the sport-fishing industry," yet guided by the voices of the researchers, their interlocutors in the recordings, the images, and the site's navigation scheme (including its maps). In a very real sense, the current navigation scheme and web design can create a sense of disorientation, which falls outside of the pleasures of rambling. What I hope to do in this review is suggest a series of minor tweaks that in the aggregate may allow the project to be both rambling and guided, without necessarily being disorienting.

First, let me clarify what I mean by disorientation. When I arrive at the site, the first thing that catches my attention is the small paragraph that invites me to explore. I have several options at this point. I can scroll down, click on the "Read more about us" button, or dive straight into the map to its right. The map is too appealing to ignore, so I click on it. It expands to replace the welcome message. I click again on the yellow circle over the Bahamas. A pin and a green circle appear as the viewport zooms in closer to the ground. I click on the green circle again. Similar effect, but now I can see the streets of Nassau. I finally click on a pin: I get an image and "The Contract." Hovering my mouse over it out of curiosity I notice there's a link, I click on that too, and arrive at an article page. After reading a few sentences of the article I realize I'm already deep in history. How did I get here? Where am I? I'm scared I did something wrong, so I return to the homepage. 

Once you start getting a sense of how the site works, everything starts making sense, but it takes a while to get there, and even then it takes a bit more time to see its conceptual coherence. Perhaps the few minor changes suggested below can help. 

1) Homepage

Much can be solved by doing most of the revision work on the homepage. Any good ramble needs a good preamble. Instead of the existing welcome message, which is too open an invitation, the user would be well served by some brief instructions to navigating the rest of the home page, re-constructed for clarity. While the map is fun, it is currently positioned in too tempting a place to help avoid disorientation. I would recommend placing it at the bottom, with the preamble above helping site visitors understand what it's doing, and perhaps even allowing it to be the unguided place.

With a strong enough narrative preamble, one would end up with three sections below it: Trails; Recent Stories; and Maps. 

Trails: “Ramble on” as an imperative is very catchy, but it needs clarification. Ramble is being used in too many senses here for it to imply simply 'visit this trail.' I can think of two solutions to this problem. Substitute “Trails” through out with “Rambles,” or simply add, “Visit this Trail” at the button. I prefer the former, since it already starts giving a more precise meaning to capital-letter Ramble, without interfering in the general sense of rambling, which the site authors want to hold on to, and while also opening the door for them to provide some critical reflections on the act of rambling through voices and streets, performed as a trans-media digital project. Something I would ask for as a reviewer, but more of that in my review of the About page.

Recent Stories: If the preamble above briefly explains what a story is, this can be left as is.

Map: There is much to say about the three kinds of maps––the general one here, the one with individual pins at the top of articles, and the one for trails. The general one can stay as is if placed at the bottom and pre-ambled by a warning that the user must find landmarks without guidance in order to arrive at a more in-depth look at a given landmark.

2) The About page

There is a great, but missed opportunity here, since this page is expected to be straightforward prose. The site already does a fantastic job of packing much information into a few paragraphs. My two suggestions for revisions are simple: 

First, add a section reflecting on the design/structure of the site as founded in the idea of rambling and on the importance of rambling/walking in the Caribbean. I think, for example, of Garnette Cadogan's “Walking While Black” (http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/), which the site authors would do well to consult. There are also other historians who have tried to reflect critically on walking and history. This would help mitigate the notion that this is simply a “where our research team publishes historical and cultural knowledge that we assemble about Bahamians and about The Bahamas.” To “publish” in such a formalized structure as a website/exhibit—different than a journal or a book—needs justification, especially when the form informs the ambitions of the project to this extent.

Second, to break down the credits at the bottom into a list where everyone's contributions and roles are noted, rather than their titles within the academic hierarchy. 

3) Browse Items

This page is almost perfect. One small confusion between "items" and "stories" can be clarified. As far as I can see, an item is a story. This is much different than the conception of item native to Omeka and familiar to Omeka users. I would simply rebrand to “Browse Stories,” or “Stories.” This would go a long way to making this page clear. To seal the deal, I would have a brief blurb at the top or below the map explaining what a Story is.

Tags: Site authors must make tags consistent, and use them throughout (perhaps around the historical themes).

4) Trails

As I suggested above, this is the place to do a lot of conceptual work around "Rambling." The trails, and this is crucial, are simply sub-collections in the Omeka sense of the word––selections from all the stories. In the future, sight authors might encounter problems with Omeka's non-overlapping collections, but maybe not. Currently, the site makes very smart use of the collections feature. The site authors should be explicit, though, about the fact that these Rambles are coming from the general collection. More importantly, they should note that this is a specific, guided form of experiencing the project.

The map: As it stands, the map seems incomplete at some zoom levels (one of the pins overlaps on the other depending on zoom), and it does not present itself as a Trail immediately. One simple tweak to show numbers instead of pins might help here. Although the numbers are visible on clicking, that isn’t immediately helpful. It would also help to clarify whether the numbers represent suggested paths on a walking tour or simply serve as indexes to the ordering below.

The blurb: "Making use of multimedia tools so as to interest audiences of all ages" is not enough. Those tools must be used in specific ways for different audiences. This is where prose helps enormously. The introduction to this section, and all future Rambles/Trails, could help synthesize the selections and provide the necessary preamble for audiences of all ages to enjoy the individual stories more fruitfully.

5) Individual Stories.

These are great, and provide the substance for the site. A few small tweaks to the design can go a long way in making these pages richer than they already are. 

a) The map pin: Make the zoom be at the street level;
b) Separate image from audio visually (different background color, dividing line, etc), and place audio above images, since audio is richer;
c) Use a more legible font for the audio caption to make sure the user understands what they are about to listen to.

In general, we should err on the side of more narrative framework for multimedia content. I understand it's a delicate balance between letting documents speak for themselves and taking on the role of curator and guide, but I think a bit more framing can vastly improve the user experience here without detracting from the primary sources.


## Review Response from the Creators of *Ramble Bahamas*

We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive and insightful feedback that they have provided in their comprehensive review of [*Ramble Bahamas*](http://www.ramblebahamas.org/). We are thrilled that the reviewer see potential in our ambitious undertaking to provide a platform combining oral history, active learning, and an exploration of Bahamian cultural heritage. We found the reviewer’s detailed narration of their first encounter with the home page to be a perceptive critique that will help guide us to build a more user-friendly experience with *Ramble Bahamas*.

The reviewer provided a series of recommendations to enhance the ease of site navigation and relieve any disorientation that may be felt by a new user. The most substantial revisions concern the addition of explanatory prose and the utilization of consistent labels. We appreciate and have heeded the recommendation to revise the home page welcome message to include explanatory instructions for site navigation. In this space, we now provide definitions for our terms *stories* and *rambles*. We have also added explanatory prose to “The Majority Rule Heritage Trail” preamble to address how specific audiences, such as students and tourists, can engage with each of the stories as well as to provide a recommendation on how to interact with the walking trail. The suggestion to rebrand “Trails” as “Rambles” to both simplify navigation and nominalize the act of rambling was an excellent one. For the sake of clarity and ease, the reviewer keenly suggested the rebranding of “Browse Items” to “Stories.” We have made these recommended edits to the navigation bar.

The review offered a number of prudent suggestions related to the embedded maps. The placement of the map on the home page is a subject we have debated internally. The reviewer noted the placement as “too tempting a place to avoid disorientation.” While our site targets a broad audience, our primary users are Bahamian secondary school students. The placement of the map has resonated in a positive way with this younger audience, and for this reason we have chosen to leave it parallel to the welcome message. We hope that the balance between detailed welcoming instructions and an interactive map will prove to be user-friendly for all audiences. For individual stories, the suggestion to automatically default the map zoom to street level was a sensible one and has been implemented sitewide. For Trails (now Rambles), the reviewer offered some ideas to provide a more visually complete trail, including the utilization of numbered marker icons rather than the current marker icons. While we considered this suggestion, it is not an option available with the current geolocation plug-in utilized by the site. As the reviewer noted, the numbers are available when clicking on each marker icon. To make this clear, we have included notes in “The Majority Rule Heritage Trail” text explaining how the numbers can be activated. The reviewer also noted the overlap of two marker icons visible at more distant zoom levels. The proximity of these two icons is unfortunate and unavoidable, since two stories took place at the same locale. In future Rambles, we will be mindful of marker icon placement when selecting and mapping our locations to avoid this kind of overlap.

The review notes a missed opportunity on our “About” page and offers several suggestions to better explain the process behind the work we undertake as public historians and the importance of “rambling” to the site creators. Moreover, the reviewer suggested how this space could be utilized as an opportunity to reflect on how *rambling*, in Bahamian parlance, means both to speak at length on a topic and to wander in an unhurried and enjoyable fashion. Interestingly, when we present *Ramble Bahamas* to outside stakeholders and audiences, we are commonly asked questions regarding the meaning of the word *ramble* and why the site’s name was chosen. Therefore, the reviewer had underscored a real and pressing opportunity to better explain a concept possibly foreign to non-Bahamians as well as to remind younger Bahamians of a pastime cherished by their elders. Per recommendation, we have taken Garnette Cadogan’s powerful “[Walking while Black](http://lithub.com/walking-while-black/)” essay to heart.[^2] This work and the reviewer’ recommendation have inspired us to expand our “About” page to include a reflection on the meaning of “rambling” which illustrates why this is an appropriate term to employ throughout the site as it conveys the kind of intellectual experience the site has to offer.

Also concerning the “About” page, the reviewer encouraged us to break down the site credits by expanding on our team members’ individual contributions and roles rather than focusing solely on their academic hierarchy. We appreciate this opportunity to elaborate on and recognize individual contributions. When finished, these personal details, along with the reflection on “rambling,” will provide an introspective look into the modus operandi that guides the work of our team. Over the coming months we will further flesh out the personal details and this reflection.

The recommendation to consistently use tags based on our research themes (national politics, nursing, education, sportfishing, and World War II and the postwar era) is welcomed and solves a problem relating to the overuse of this feature, which we have debated for some time. To effectively and consistently utilize the tags feature, we have decided to implement only tags related to our formal research foci. Commenting on the multimedia captions, the reviewer astutely pointed out the fine balance between “letting documents speak for themselves and taking on the role of \[a\] curator.” The recommendation to provide more framing to improve the user experience will be effective for upcoming stories. Finally, the reviewer suggested several changes to improve the design of the individual story pages. These edits (placement of the oral history audio clips, visual separation of the audio and image sections, and a more legible audio caption font) are sensible and will be integrated in future site updates.
